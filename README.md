Welcome to Wack, a simple chat web application emulating the famous 'Slack.' This was made for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript course (2018 edition). 

What you'll find in each file:
- index.html: HTML template for the website
- application.py: Server-side communcation
- index.js: Client-side communication
- wack.css: Stylesheets

I simplified the site enough so that only one file was needed for each aspect-- one template, one file for the server, one file for the client, and one stylesheet.

## Personal Touches
For my personal touches, I made it so that users can see every other user that is currently in the channel they are in. It updates when users leave the channel. I also created a home page whose landing message was different depending on whether the user has visited the site, or is doing so for the first time. And finally, I made it so that when a user made a channel, that channel had a "Welcome" message from the Wack-Bot to initialize the conversation.
